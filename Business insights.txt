Business Insights & Analysis

This project provides an in-depth overview of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) market performance using real-world stock trading data.
Each insight was derived by cleaning, aggregating, and analyzing the dataset in PostgreSQL, and then visualized in Google Sheets to support data-driven decisions

1. Market Coverage & Data Scope

Total Stocks Analyzed: 50 companies listed on the NSE.

This scope provides a balanced sample of large-cap and mid-cap stocks, suitable for understanding market movement patterns.

The analysis focuses on daily-level trading metrics such as open, high, low, last traded price (LTP), turnover, and percentage change

2. Total Market Turnover and Volume

Turnover: ₹28,485.34 Crores

Trading Volume: 3,565.33 Lakhs shares

This indicates a high liquidity day in the market, suggesting strong investor participation and confidence.
Turnover and volume together represent the total market activity — higher numbers mean more active trading sessions


3. Top Performing Stocks (Turnover & Volume Leaders)

Top 10 Companies:
ADANIPORTS, ASIANPAINT, AXISBANK, BAJAJ-AUTO, BAJAJFINSV, BAJFINANCE, BHARTIARTL, BPCL, BRITANNIA, CIPLA

These companies dominate trading activity, showing strong investor interest and consistent liquidity.
They represent key sectors like banking, automotive, FMCG, and telecom, indicating diversified market movement rather than sector-specific spikes

4. Gainers & Losers by Daily % Change

The top gainers and losers show a maximum daily fluctuation of around -5.90%.

A negative range within 5–6% suggests moderate market volatility, which is common in mixed market sentiment days.

Some companies saw pullbacks after strong prior growth phases

5. Trend Analysis — Short-Term vs Long-Term

30-Day Performance: -4.65%

365-Day Performance: +79.22%

This shows that despite a short-term dip, the long-term market trend is strongly positive, signaling long-run investor confidence and recovery potential.
It also highlights that recent corrections are minor within an overall bullish trend, typical after sustained growth phases

6. Volatility & Investment Direction

Variations in Open, High, Low, and LTP values across stocks show that volatility is uneven, with some stocks experiencing sharper intra-day swings.

This helps investors identify potentially high-risk, high-reward stocks for trading versus stable long-term options

7. Business Implications

For Investors: The dashboard enables quick detection of top-performing sectors and companies, aiding portfolio diversification.

For Analysts: Simplifies trend tracking — especially in identifying shifts between short-term corrections and long-term performance.

For Brokers: Offers actionable insights into trading activity and stock movement concentration
