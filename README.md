## Business Recommendation -->

1. **Focus on High-Turnover, High-Volume Stocks**
Companies like **ADANIPORTS, AXISBANK, BAJFINANCE,** and **ASIANPAINT** consistently dominate both turnover and trading volume
These stocks show strong market liquidity — meaning investors can enter or exit positions easily without significant price distortion

2.**Leverage Long-Term Positive Momentum**
The market’s 365-day growth (+79.22%) clearly outpaces its short-term 30-day dip (-4.65%)
This signals short-term correction rather than a long-term bearish phase

3.**Manage Risk Through Diversification**
Top-performing companies span across multiple industries — Banking, FMCG, Automotive, and Telecom — reducing sector concentration risk

4.**Identify Volatile Stocks for Trading Opportunities**
Stocks with wider gaps between High and Low prices indicate intraday volatility and greater potential for traders seeking short-term profits

5.**Monitor Short-Term Weakness**
The -4.65% 30-day change suggests some short-term pressure, possibly due to profit-booking or external market sentiment shifts

## 🏁 Conclusion -->

This project provides a concise and data-driven view of NSE market performance, helping users quickly identify top-performing stocks, analyze market movement, and understand trading activity across sectors.
It showcases the integration of SQL for analytics and Google Sheets for visualization, demonstrating end-to-end data analysis capability.
